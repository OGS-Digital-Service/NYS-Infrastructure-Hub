# NY State Infrastructure Hub Front-end
Compartmentalized components for [infrastructure.ny.gov](https://infrastructure.ny.gov)

Built with an 11ty shell for local development and component generation. Each component can be rendered in isolation using render-layout.njk as the template. The resulting code can be copied and pasted into the full html embed option in ArcGIS Hub.
